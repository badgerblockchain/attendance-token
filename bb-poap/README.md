# Subgraph

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

OR

```bash
yarn
```

> This will install `graph-cli`, `graph-ts`, and `prettier`

Then go to the graph's [website](https://thegraph.com/en/) and move to the hosted service, then login with your github account.

> "Hosted Service" > "Add Subgraph"

## Build

Here it is simple, you need to run 2 commands. If both work the subgraph will properly deploy.

```bash
graph codegen
graph build
```

## Deploy

Here you need to set your authentication token like this:

```bash
graph auth --product hosted-service [REDACTED]
```

Then you can deploy using this command:

```bash
graph deploy --product hosted-service yourgithubname/badger-token
```

> _Note_: make sure you are replacing the values above with what you created.

### Congratulations

You deployed a Badge Token subgraph! Now paste the endpoint in your browser and play around in the studio to see if it works.

> Note that the `./generated` and `./build` folders are autogenerated and should not be commited to github!
