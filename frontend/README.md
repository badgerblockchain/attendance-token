# Welcome to our Dapp's Frontend

## Install and run commands

```bash
npm install
npm run start # this spins up a local server
```

## Setting `.env` Variables

Using the `.env.exmaple` as a guide, create a file in the `frontend` dir (in the root) called `.env`. Go to [Infura](https://app.infura.io/login?_ga=2.136662000.1344465461.1672861652-2056521109.1672861652) and sign up. Once signed in, create a new project and grab a new **ethereum** key. Use mainnet. Add this url to the `.env` file.

Note, you will need to stop and restart your server for `.env` variable changes to be noticed. Also, react enforces a prefix of `REACT_APP_` on all variables.
